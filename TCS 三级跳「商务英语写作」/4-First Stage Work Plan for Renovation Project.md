Dear Lester:

This is to send you my work plan during the first stage of renovation project: Jan 1,2013 - Mar 31,2013.

1. Conduct upfront research on the office building.
- The condition of building and its ability to support any renovations
- The age and operating condition of mechanical and electrical systems
- The quality of existing utilities
- The accuracy of past site evaluations 
- Any historic elements

2. Put together an effective team.
- An architectural and interior design team
- A qualified,reputable general contractor

3. Determine budget.
- All available funds
- Contingency funds

4. Develop a realistic schedule.
- The date that the new office must be ready
- Sufficient time for each project phase

I believe my proactive planning will help sidestep the headaches that might otherwise plague the project.
I look forward to meeting you for more discussion sometime before Friday.
Would you please give some time slots when you are avaible? Thank you!
