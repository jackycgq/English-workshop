Dear all,

I am writing to ask for your cooperation on our working plan. I believe this temporary moving will **significantly** enhance the renovation speed and gurantee that you enjoy a better working environment sooner.

For many years, our Shanghai branch has bee **operating with one hand tied behind us**（捉襟见肘，很困难运作）. Our space is small and our office shabby. Renovating the branch would prepare us for the DB launch of "Focus on China" initiative. This would also reduce, **if not eliminate**(如果不能排除 ), the need for support from overseas branches.

Here are the details of the moving:

##Procedure
1. Get the new office mao from your supervisor.
2. Obtain the packing materials from the administrative assitant.
3. Pack your files/desk/equipment/personal items, and mark your name.
4. Put the packages that contain sensitive itmes like fragile or delicate machinery to the appoited area.
5. **Settle in** （调整适应）the new office after moving the moving company has completed their job


##Time 
1. You will have five hours to do the packing from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.,May 15. The old office area will need to be emptied by 6:00 p.m. on the same day.
2. The moving company will work from 5:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. on May 16.
3. You will unpack your packages and **organize your new working area** from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.,May 16.
