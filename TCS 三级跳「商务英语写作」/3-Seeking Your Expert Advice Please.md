Dear Mr. Nevo,

This is to sincerely seek your expert advice on office renovaton project.

I am Lala Du,Sales Administrative Assitant in Shanghai Office.It is a shame that I have not got a chance to contact you even though we are in the same field within DB. But I have heard a lot about you, and especially your outstanding achivement on the renovation project in New York office last year.

Due to lack of hands, I was appointed to organize the renovation for Shanghai office. It is the first time for me to take such an important and chanllenging task. So your valuable advice would be very much appreciated.

Would it be possible to talk with you on phone for about 15 minutes next week? I look forward to the suggestions on the budge,procedure,personnel, and other issues you think worth mentioning.

If you are not the best person for me to contact,then I do apolize and would be very grateful if you could direct me to correct person.

Thank you for your time.
