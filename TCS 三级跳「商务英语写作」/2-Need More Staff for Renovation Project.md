Dear Lester,

Thank you for trusting me to lead Shanghai office renovation project. The strategic assignment will **engage my talent **of program management in administration field. In order to successfully complete the project,I need addtional staff.

### Background
As you know, Rose is on sick leave and Mary has left the position of Administration Supervisor in Shanghai office. I only have Maggie in Shanghai, **whose hands are already full**.Besides,I can not drop my duties as Administration Supervisor for Guangzhou Office. Therefore,we do not have **one single full-time employee** on this important project.

As shown in my proposal, more than 300 working days is needed over the six months for this porject to complete on time. That is the working time of two full-time employees and one part-time employee, which would be me. I do not mind working extra hours,but **the bottom line is the quality control of the project.**

Three years ago,Rose had two full-time temporary employees to aid her in Beijing renovation project, which is smaller than this one.

### Solutions

There are three options for you to consider to gain the needed staff:

1. We pick three staff with administration experience within DB and assign part of their workload to this project.This cost the company less,since there is no need to pay for **recruiters**(猎头).

2.We hire two new full-time employees on a six-month contract **from an external pool of candidates.** This ensures the current staff keeping their regular job duties.

3.We combine both ways: get two part-time employees from inside and one full-time outside.

Shall we start the project on my suggestion as a test? **We can adjust the details as project envolves.**Thank you for your consideration!
