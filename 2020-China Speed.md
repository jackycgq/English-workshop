We're here to talk about the remarkable days of 2020. Speaking of 2020,COVID 19 is something that has to be mentioned of course. 
It's like a thorn in the flesh for everyone. It's right there,it's annoying and there is no way to overlook it.
But I am not here to talk about the consequecenses it has brought to us.I want to talk about how we coped with it.
I want to talk about Huoshenshan Hospital. It is an emergency speciality field hospital built in Wuhan,China, in repsonse to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Construction of the hospital began on the evening of Jan 23rd ,and the last brick was placed on February 2nd. It took only 10 days for the whole construction.A hospital was built within 10 days and ready to receive patients.That's what we call "China speed".

Here is another remarkable day of 2020.On April 28th, a new generation demostic medium-low-speed maglev train reached a top speed of 160 km per hour.It has a 30-percent increase in traction efficiency and a 60-percent increase in speed.That's what we call "China-speed". For high-speed maglev train, it can go to 600km per hour."China speed" can be seen in other aspects too.
